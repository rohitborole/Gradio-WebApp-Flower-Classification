# Gradio Web App for Flower Classification

This repository contains code for a web application built using Gradio that classifies images of flowers into different categories.

## Overview

The project utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to classify flower images uploaded by users through a web interface. Gradio is used to create a simple yet effective user interface where users can upload an image, and the model predicts the type of flower present in the image.

## Features

- **Upload Image:** Users can upload an image of a flower through the web interface.
- **Prediction:** The deep learning model predicts the type of flower in the image from a set of predefined categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Gradio provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the model without needing deep technical knowledge.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
